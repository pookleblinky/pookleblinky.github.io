<p>I tend to get flustered when learning languages. I bounce from one to another, trying the same thing in each. &ldquo;oh cool how would I do this in foo? Ah, gotta yakshave my emacs for bar.&rdquo; Since every programming language sucks, I end up endlessly plunging down rabbit holes trying to yakshave things to work properly and smoothly. My focus gets distributed among n languages, m setups, and p annoyances. In this vast space, I end up wandering stochastically and occasionally bumping into useful things. This is no way to conquer a territory and hear the dialup modem screeching lamentations of its robots as you chase them before you.</p>

<p>Little ends up getting done, and I end up working at a cartoonishly slow pace as I bounce around playing with everything. Despite learning, I end up with little to show for it, and the lack of structure means I end up following an interesting avenue and completely neglecting what is usually considered a vital part of the language.</p>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m focusing on Racket, Elixir, Clojure, and Common Lisp. oCaml, LFE, and Haskell as background noise, not the main focus. Clojure is a bit lower priority than Elixir; it&rsquo;s just not a good lisp and the dev is not fun on a low-end device. Elixir is a better lisp than clojure and it&rsquo;s not even trying. It didn&rsquo;t even bother to bring its bag full of parentheses to the party and it still kicks clojure&rsquo;s ass. Reminder to rant about this later.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity to get distracted on several levels, from other languages to yakshaving dev environments and workflows for them.</p>

<p>For instance, my normal workflow involves vim-slime and tmux. Vim-slime sends text to a specified tmux pane, it doesn&rsquo;t know or care what repl is on the other end. It doesn&rsquo;t know or care about nrepl or swank or any of that. Just where to dump the text. I prefer this over magic. Well, in LFE slurping a file into the repl dumps all previously slurped macros and defs. The repl is more stateful than most, so the workflow is a little awkward. I was pondering how to tweak vim-slime to have an LFE mode that would on C-c C-c first save, then send over the text (c "@%"), or something. I could yakshave on this happily, but it&rsquo;s a distraction. I&rsquo;m trying to minimize as much as possible the temptation to yakshave, so I forced myself mid-fork of vim-slime into lfe-slurp to stop and just accept a bit of extra typing.</p>

<p>My attempted solution to the focus problem is simple. For focus, I&rsquo;m using exercism. Each language is on a different track, each has defined tasks to accomplish and progress is tracked. Most tracks have similar tasks, which nicely satisfies my &ldquo;oh man I wonder how I&rsquo;d do this in foo&rdquo; impulse, but in a structured and focused way. Yakshaving is kept to a minimum: while working in racket, I can pop over to another pane, type &ldquo;langjournal,&rdquo; and note a todo about yakshaving vim to work better with it. Later, I can yakshave, but I can keep focused on what I was doing instead of falling down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I also have an enormous folder of interesting code laying on my 2tb external harddrive, from language cores and projects to ebooks. I can browse, offline, all the code I could want. Obviously, without structure I could endlessly study this without ever doing anything useful. With even a modicum of enforced structure, this actually becomes useful, instead of a labyrinth through which I&rsquo;m chasing my own tail.</p>

<p>While doing the erlang track, I saw that rebar.config hardcoded rebar3. I did the task, gsubbed rebar3 to rebar (v2 is what I had), and ran the tests. They passed, I made a note. Went on #erlang, asked about rebar3, and decided to upgrade. I bootstrapped it in less than a minute, reverted rebar.config, and it worked as intended. Minimal yakshaving.</p>

<p>I figure as long as I keep things structured, push yakshaving out of the way into its own activity (&ldquo;today I&rsquo;m gonna get vim to work better with lfe&rdquo;), and avoid temptation, I&rsquo;ll have a much nicer time than my usual habits provide. Then, I&rsquo;ll actually get stuff done, comprehensibly, instead of amassing largely useless knowledge.</p>

<p>This blog is going to be part of my workflow, forcing me to maintain a coherency which is usually lost reinventing a local PLEAC.</p>
