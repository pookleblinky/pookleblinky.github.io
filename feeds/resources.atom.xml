&lt;p&gt;On #Racket, samth linked to &lt;a href="http://exercism.io/languages/racket"&gt;Exercism&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful analog to $LANG Koans. Each exercise is a basic, small program which you code by satisfying the unit tests. Unlike, say, Clojure Koans, &lt;a href="http://exercism.io/languages/clojure"&gt;the Clojure Track of Exercism&lt;/a&gt; has you create 58 programs of various degrees of complexity, rather than a running through individual test assertions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You code enough to pass the tests, then submit. You can keep tweaking your solution, and keep submitting it. On your dashboard, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see how your solution has evolved over time. You can also look at how other people solved the problem, discuss solutions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercism, with its emphasis on creating programs and then discussing them, is an even better way to introduce a language than a standard koan runner. Especially considering that if you already know the language, instead of solving the exercises you can easily submit new ones for others to solve.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
