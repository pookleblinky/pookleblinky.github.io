<p>After so long on twitter, I'm unused to longform writing, despite all my
threads. I'm just used to expressing things 140 characters at a time, as this
paragraph indicates.</p>

<p>This will be my first foray into longform writing. I'll probably end up
parasitizing off my twitter threads, who knows.</p>

<p>About this site: I figured I wanted to blog, but I never want to leave vim to do
it. Setting up a github static page with jekyll was the laziest possible way to
accomplish this. Literally took 5 minutes, didn't need to leave my terminal
once.</p>

<p>Fuck trump. </p>
