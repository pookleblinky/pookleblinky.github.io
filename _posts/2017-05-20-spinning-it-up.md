So, I've set up a blog. Creating it was the easy part. Configuring it turned out
to be more difficult. [Switching from an existing Jekyll
layout](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31327045/switch-theme-in-an-existing-jekyll-installation)
Turns out to be a pain in the ass. So, I'm just not gonna switch. 

Then, I broke permalinks, made pages load weird by duplicating the _layouts
which the default theme doesn't require (Ah, there's that annoying ruby magic),
and then broke more shit. Repeatedly broke shit for a while, seeing what's
hidden in the ruby magic. More annoyingly, the localhost preview doesn't
indicate some things are broken, you only discover them after pushing to the
server. I will probably end up changing from Jekyll, and then building my own
static site generator (this seems to be the main sequence of using github
pages).

Now I just have to figure out what to write. Years of using twitter have left me
unable to write in long chunks. In threads, you still get accustomed to chunking
thoughts into small enough pieces to fit into tweets. The luxurious space
afforded to a blogpost is overwhelming. 

What to write? Well, the question is really what *not* to write. I write
constantly, but in tweets and toots. I need to make writing twitter threads more
annoying than writing here.

This is a wonderful opportunity to streamline my workflow, on every level: from
editing to git. So many things that can be automated away, so much grudgework
eliminated. I have a feeling many of my first posts will just be me discovering
new ways to break shit, intentionally or by accident.
