Ah, gotta yakshave my emacs for bar.&rdquo; Since every programming language sucks, I end up endlessly plunging down rabbit holes trying to yakshave things to work properly and smoothly. My focus gets distributed among n languages, m setups, and p annoyances. In this vast space, I end up wandering stochastically and occasionally bumping into useful things. This is no way to conquer a territory and hear the dialup modem screeching lamentations of its robots as you chase them before you.</p>\n\n<p>Little ends up getting done, and I end up working at a cartoonishly slow pace as I bounce around playing with everything. Despite learning, I end up with little to show for it, and the lack of structure means I end up following an interesting avenue and completely neglecting what is usually considered a vital part of the language.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m focusing on Racket, Elixir, Clojure, and Common Lisp. oCaml, LFE, and Haskell as background noise, not the main focus. Clojure is a bit lower priority than Elixir; it&rsquo;s just not a good lisp and the dev is not fun on a low-end device. Elixir is a better lisp than clojure and it&rsquo;s not even trying. It didn&rsquo;t even bother to bring its bag full of parentheses to the party and it still kicks clojure&rsquo;s ass.
