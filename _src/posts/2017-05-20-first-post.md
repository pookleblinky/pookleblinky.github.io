After so long on twitter, I'm unused to longform writing, despite all my
threads. I'm used to expressing things 140 characters at a time, as this
paragraph indicates.

This will be my first foray into longform writing in a while. I'll probably end
up parasitizing off my twitter threads.

About this site: I figured I wanted to blog, but I never want to leave vim/emacs
to do it. Setting up a github static page with Jekyll was the laziest possible
way to accomplish this. Literally took 5 minutes.

Edit: Immediately switched to [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog),
which is a static site generator written in Racket which works on Google Pages.
Spinning that up was a little more work, as GP doesn't let you simply branch,
install an alternate generator, and set that second branch as the display.
Still, took only a few minutes.
