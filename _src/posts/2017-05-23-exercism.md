On #Racket, samth linked to [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/racket), a
wonderful analog to $LANG Koans. Each exercise is a basic, small program which
you code by satisfying the unit tests. Unlike, say, Clojure Koans, [the Clojure
Track of Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/clojure) has you create 58
programs of various degrees of complexity, rather than a running through
individual test assertions.

You code enough to pass the tests, then submit. You can keep tweaking your
solution, and keep submitting it. On your dashboard, you'll be able to see how
your solution has evolved over time. You can also look at how other people
solved the problem, discuss solutions, etc. 

Exercism, with its emphasis on creating programs and then discussing them, is an
even better way to introduce a language than a standard koan runner. Especially
considering that if you already know the language, instead of solving the
exercises you can easily submit new ones for others to solve.
