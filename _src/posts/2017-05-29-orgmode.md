I'm spending some time getting org-mode configured the way I want. I'm
trying to keep things as simple as possible, given how much yakshave
potential there is in org mode. I have only a few files in ~/org:
   orgfile.org
   blog.org
   code.org
   refile.org

Orgfile.org, which is the default general agenda file. It's
structured like this:
   datetree
   links
   notes
   tasks
   orgstuff
My blog.org is just a datetree.

Code.org is tough to figure out how to structure it. I initially
thought of organizing by language, but I don't like how that lacks
telos. It encourages dicking around with no goal, just bouncing from
thing to thing. I could organize by project, but that similarly lacks
focus if there are multiple projects to bounce around in. I settled on
just a datetree and tags. A datetree encourages a daily log of what I
intend to do, what I actually did, and where I am going. I can just
filter by tags and date until this becomes insufficient and I need to
split off a project, in which case I'd rather add it to code.org
instead of making a new orgfile. Again, I want to try as hard as
possible to discourage dicking around bouncing from one thing to
another without a goal.
